We are off to explore the sea!*
Air tanks help us to breathe underwater.*
We take photos of the bright and busy coral reef.*
Watch out for the pufferfish!*
We need a submersible to explore the dark depths of the sea.*
Only the toughest creatures can survive down here.*
It is time to rise to the surface.*
We have seen so many amazing creatures!*
Goodbye, sea!
