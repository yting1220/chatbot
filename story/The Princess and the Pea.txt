Once there was a prince.*
"I will only marry a real princess," said the prince.*
"Is she a real princess?" said the prince.*
"No," said the queen.*
"That girl is not a real princess."*
"Is she a real princess?" said the prince.*
"No," said the queen.*
"That girl is not a real princess."*
One day, another girl went to see the prince.*
"Is she a real princess?" said the prince.*
"I hope she is."*
"We will see," said the queen.*
The queen put a pea on the bed.*
Next, she put a mattress on the pea.*
The queen put another mattress on the bed.*
She put on another mattress, and another and another.*
The girl went to bed.*
The next day, the queen said, "Did you sleep well?"*
"No," said the girl.*
"I did not sleep well. There was a pea in the bed."*
"Is she a real princess?" said the prince.*
"Yes!" said the queen.*
"She is a real princess."*
"Will you marry me?" said the prince.*
"I hope you will."*
"Yes," said the girl.*
"But only if you are a real prince!"
