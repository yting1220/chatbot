Today was Secret Santa Day at Robin Hill School.*
Katie wore her Christmas sweater.*
She skipped into class.*
"That reindeer looks like a raccoon," said Andrew.*
Katie stopped skipping.*
"Secret Santa time," said Mrs Connor.*
She gave each student a piece of paper.*
"We write our names," said James.*
"We fold the paper," said Eigen.*
"We put them in the Santa hat," said Ayanna.*
"Rudolph Raccoon," Andrew whispered to Katie.*
"You are mean," Katie whispered back.*
"Close your eyes and pick a name," said Mrs Connor.*
When it was Katie's turn, she made a wish.*
"I hope I do not get Andrew," she thought.*
She got Andrew.*
At home that night Katie told her mom what Andrew had said.*
"I will not get Andrew a present," said Katie.*
"Hmm," said her mom.*
The next day, everyone talked about their presents.*
"I will give Hannah a mug!" said Jamie.*
"I know what I will give Becky!" said Eigen.*
"I will give Nick a car!" said Nia.*
Katie did not say anything.*
On Monday, Katie's mom gave her a present for Andrew.*
But Katie did not take it to school.*
When it was almost time to give out presents, Katie started to cry.*
"What is wrong?" asked Mrs Connor.*
"I do not have a present for Andrew," said Katie.*
"He was mean so I wanted to be mean too. But now I want to be nice."*
"We have time to make a present together," said Mrs Connor.*
They went to the craft corner and began to make something.*
At last it was time for presents.*
Jamie got a pencil case.*
Reza got a pen with four colors.*
Katie opened her present.*
It was a reindeer.*
"Sorry," said Andrew.*
"And merry Christmas!"*
Katie gave Andrew his present.*
It was a raccoon.*
"Sorry," said Katie.*
"And merry Christmas!"*
Hannah loved her mug.*
Becky loved her book.*
Nick loved his car.*
But Andrew and Katie loved their presents best of all.
