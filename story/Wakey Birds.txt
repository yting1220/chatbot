The jungle is an exotic place full of fascinating creatures.*
One of the most interesting species is called the Wakey Bird.*
Wakey Birds get their name because they have trouble falling asleep.*
If we take a closer look, we can see why.*
They can not get comfortable.*
They are easily spooked.*
They have lots of BIG thoughts.*
They get itchy.*
Thankfully, the jungle also has Soothing Shushers and Go-To-Sleep Leapers.*
A Soothing Shusher looks like this and a Go-To-Sleep Leaper looks like this!*
These creatures help settle the Wakey Birds down with calming noises.*
Then the birds go back to their nests where they finally close their eyes and drift off to sleep.*
Except for the Littlest Wakey Bird.*
Tonight, she is just not tired.*
It is not much fun being the only one awake.*
Instead of sleeping, she wants to play a game of hide-and-go-peep.*
Except there are no other Wakeys to come and find her.*
She is getting lonely.*
She is getting very sad.*
She is getting a stick to wake the others up!*
Of course, they are delighted to join the fun.*
But now things have got very loud!*
These Wakeys need to watch out or they will wake up the loudest animal in the jungle.*
The Shrieking Monkey.*
No! No! No! It is definitely way too loud and this time they really need to be careful, or they will disturb the one animal that should never, ever be disturbed.*
The Dreaded Jungle Beast.*
"Who dares disturb my slumber?"*
Oh, dear. The Dreaded Jungle Beast has come out of his cave.*
The Littlest Wakey Bird is so scared she can not move.*
She had better speak up before she gets chomped!*
Well then, know just what to do with you. Wait here.*
The Dreaded Jungle Beast goes back into his deep, dark cave.*
What is he doing?*
The Littlest Wakey Bird is scared she will become a midnight snack.*
She is trembling with terror!*
Finally, the Beast returns with a STOMP.*
He is carrying a great big storybook!*
The Wakey Birds have never heard a story before.*
They huddle in nice and close and the Dreaded Jungle Beast begins to read in his deep, beastly voice.*
Soon the Wakey Birds are not feeling so wakey anymore.*
But the Littlest Wakey Bird is still not asleep.*
Never mind. She is now.*
And the rest of the jungle is too.
