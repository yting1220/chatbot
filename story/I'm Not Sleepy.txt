"It is time for bed, Ned!" says Mummy.*
But Ned is not at all sleepy.*
He is playing with his train.*
Mummy runs the bath.*
"Even train drivers go to bed, Ned," she says.*
"But I am not sleepy," says Ned, hopping into the bath.*
"I will time you while you brush your teeth," says Mummy.*
"I am still not sleepy," says Ned.*
"Not even a little bit."*
Ned puts on his snuggly pyjamas.*
"I am still not sleepy," he says.*
"Shall we look at your favorite book?" says Mummy.*
Mummy tucks Ned in and sings him a song.*
It is a song about twinkling stars.*
"I am ... still ... not.."*
But Ned does not finish speaking.*
He is fallen fast asleep!
