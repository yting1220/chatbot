Wake up, zebra.*
Look, here's some water!*
Stop and sip.*
Graze the grass. Yum!*
The zebra grooms its baby.*
Now its hair is clean.*
The baby's body has stripes.*
They are black and white.*
No two zebras' stripes look exactly alike!*
Stripes make the zebra blend into the grass.*
This helps the zebra hide and stay safe.*
Watch out! There is a lion!*
The zebra calls to its baby.*
They run away with their herd.*
The baby runs to keep up.*
Go, baby zebra, go!*
Here's some new grass.*
Let's eat and rest.*
It was a busy day.*
Time for the zebra to sleep.*
Good night, zebra!
