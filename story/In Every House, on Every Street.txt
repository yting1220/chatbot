Our house is made out of four walls and a door, some wonky old bricks and a wobbly old floor.*
But I have got a secret.*
Come this way with me!*
I will show you some things that you can not always see.*
In this room we bake, but we never just bake...*
We sing into spoons and get covered in cake!*
We dance in our aprons and taste what we make.*
We work as a team when we are learning to bake.*
In this room we eat, but we never just eat ...*
We party like pirates and hunt for a treat!*
We climb under tables and tickle some feet.*
We share lots of giggles each time that we eat.*
In this room we chat, but we never just chat ...*
We dress up like rock stars and sing to the cat!*
We play silly games but it is more than just that.*
We say how we are feeling at home when we chat.*
In this room we rest, but we never just rest ...*
We slouch on the couch in a big comfy nest!*
We talk through our day and get things off our chest.*
We figure stuff out while we are getting some rest.*
In this room we clean, but we never just clean ...*
We pull funny faces and try to look mean!*
We paint works of art that will never be seen.*
We work through our worries as well as get clean.*
In this room we sleep, but we never just sleep...*
We hide under pillows and try not to peep!*
We build giant castles and count fluffy sheep.*
We comfort each other at night before sleep.*
In this house we play, but we never just play ...*
We clear up the mess at the end of the day.*
We learn to say sorry and wipe tears away.*
We love every minute, at home, when we play.*
Our street has got chimneys and wonky old bricks.*
With windows and wobbly old floors we could fix.*
But under the ceilings, behind all the doors ... I wonder if our house is rather like yours?
