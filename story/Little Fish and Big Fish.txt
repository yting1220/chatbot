A rock moves.*
It is not a rock.*
It is a fish.*

A boat moves.*
It is not a boat.*
It is a fish.*
"l am the biggest fish in the sea," says the very very big fish.*
They swim to a cave.*
It is not a cave.*
It is a fish.*
"l am the biggest fish in the sea," says the very very very big fish.*
"And you will all be my supper!"*
"Not me," says Little Fish.*
Little Fish gets in a shell.*
"0w!" says a little crab.*
"You sat on me, you big, big fish!"
