We want to go on a fun trip!*
I want to go to the circus.*
Teddy wants to go to the sea.*
And Giraffe wants to go to a castle.*
"Let's go to the library," says Otter Keeper.*
"Is the library fun, like a circus?" I ask.*
"You will see," says Otter Keeper.*
The library is big.*
There are lots of books.*
I get my own library card.*
Otter Keeper says I can choose some books.*
There are so many books!*
I can't choose.*
We ask for help.*
I find a lot of books that I like.*
"Sit down with me," says Otter Keeper.*
It is time to read.*
The first book we read is about the circus.*
Reading about the circus is fun!*
The next book is about the sea.*
Teddy likes this book.*
The next book is about a magic castle.*
Giraffe wants to read this again.*
The last book is about pirates.*
We all pretend we are pirates!*
Oh no, we have read all the books!*
There are a lot more books at the library.*
We can choose more to take home.*
"Do you like the library?" asks Otter Keeper.*
"I love the library. That was the best trip ever!" I say.*
We have had a busy day.*
It is time for bed.*
But we can't go to sleep yet.*
We need to read one more book!
