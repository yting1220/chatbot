Alice and Jack were out playing catch when they heard something.*
"What is that noise?" said Jack.*
"It is coming from the forest," said Alice.*
"Let's go and see!"*
"But what if it's the Wicked Wolf?" said Jack.*
"I want to go home."*
"Shhh," said Alice.*
"Everything is going to be all right."*
And she held Jack's hand.*
Alice and Jack were stepping into the forest when they heard something.*
"What is that noise?" said Jack.*
"I do not like it."*
"Let's go and see," said Alice.*
"But what if it is the Wicked Wolf," said Jack, "with his big bad claws?"*
"Shhh," said Alice.*
"Everything is going to be all right."*
Alice and Jack were creeping through the forest when they heard something.*
"What is that noise?" said Jack.*
"We sre lost!"*
"It is just over there," said Alice.*
"Let's go and see."*
"What if it is the Wicked Wolf," said Jack, "with his big bad claws and his snap-trap jaws?"*
"Shhh," said Alice.*
"Everything is going to be all right."*
"I want to be home," said Jack.*
"I want to be warm and wearing my pyjamas. I want to be snuggled down deep."*
"We have to be brave," said Alice.*
And that is when they heard it, very close now.*
"It is right in front of us!" said Jack.*
Big bad claws, snap-trap jaws, the wicked wolf!*
"RUN!" cried Alice.*
"All the way home!"*
But Jack did not move.*
"The Wolf is not wicked," said Jack.*
"The Wolf is a mummy... That is what the noise is! Wolf Mummy is singing her babies to sleep! Look!"*
"Everything is all right," said Jack.*
Then he gave a great big yawn.*
"It is time to go home."*
And he held Alice's hand.*
Alice and Jack walked back through the forest, and all the way home.*
They got into their nice, warm pyjamas and snuggled down deep.*
And they sailed off to sleep on that sweet lullaby.
