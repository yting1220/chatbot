"Faster!" laughed Leopard, leaping through the air.*
"Hop-along!" cried Kangaroo.*
"No time to stand and stare!"*
But Snail slid slowly through the middle of the crush.*
"There is space for someone small like me. I am sure there is no rush!"*
"It is not even raining yet. I know that Noah will not sail!"*
"I am just a slow, slow, one-toe, gently-does-it, come-and-go, slip-sliding, slithery snail!"*
"Hurry, Snail!" huffed Hippo.*
"You will soon be left down there."*
"Hurry, Snail!" buzzed Bumblebee, whizzing through the air.*
"You hurry!" sighed the snail below.*
"I know that Noch will not sail!"*
"He knows I am a slow, slow, one-toe, a gently-does-it, come-and-go, slip-sliding, slithery snail!"*
But up above, the clouds grew black.*
A dot of rain, a spot of rain and soon rain poured in rivers down every creature's back.*
"Quickly, friends!" begged Noah now.*
"This water is rising fast!"*
"Let's have you all on board this boat before she sails at last!"*
Snail slowly slid towards the plank.*
"I do not want to race!"*
"I am just a slow, slow, one-toe, gently-does-it, come-and-go, slip-sliding, slithery snail!" she said, with smiling face.*
The claws and hooves stomped up the plank with bellows, cries and roars.*
But Snail knew how to reach the top, away from stomping paws!*
"Welcome, welcome!" Noah cried.*
"You have had a long, long trail! Welcome, little slow, one-toe, slip-sliding, slithery snail!"
