There is a butterfly on Rocket's nose.*
"Hello, butterfly," says Rocket.*
He wags his tail.*
The butterfly flies away.*
"Wait," Rocket says.*
Rocket is fast.*
The butterfly is faster.*
The butterfly flies up the hill.*
Rocket runs up the hill.*
The butterfly flies past the pond.*
Rocket runs past the pond.*
The butterfly rests on a flower.*
Rocket rests, too.*
The butterfly flies off.*
"Wait!" Rocket says.*
The butterfly flies into the forest.*
Rocket stops.*
The forest is very dark.*
The trees are very tall.*
Rocket does not want to go into the forest.*
"The forest is very scary," he says to himself.*
Rocket thinks for a moment.*
The butterfly was not afraid to go into the forest.*
The butterfly was brave.*
Maybe the forest is not scary.*
Rocket walks into the forest.*
It is very dark.*
It is very quiet.*
There are many tall trees.*
There are pinecones, and ferns, and the butterfly.*
"Hello, butterfly," says Rocket.*
The forest is not so scary after all.*
Rocket likes the forest.*
Rocket is brave.
