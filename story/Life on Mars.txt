I am on Mars.*
I have traveled a long way from Earth.*
I am here to find life.*
Everybody thinks I am crazy.*
Nobody believes there is life on Mars.*
But I do.*
And I just know that I am going to find it.*
So far, Mars looks pretty gloomy.*
More gloomy than I thought.
I am starting to wonder could anything possibly live here?*
It is dark.*
It is cold.*
I have brought this gift of chocolate cupcakes.*
I do not think I will find anybody to eat them.*
Wow. I was wrong. Mars is nothing but miles and miles of rocks and dirt!*
It's obvious.*
Nothing could possibly live here!*
What a disaster.*
Everybody was right: There is no life on Mars!*
I am going home immediately.*
Uh-oh. Where is my spaceship?*
I can not believe it.*
I am lost!*
Lost on Mars, where there is no life.*
Wait a minute. What is that?*
No way! It is life!*
It is on Mars, and it is alive!*
What an amazing discovery!*
I can not wait to get back to Earth and show everybody what I found.*
And look-my box of cupcakes!*
How did it get there?*
Now I have got to find my spaceship.*
I bet I will get a good view from the top of that mountain.*
Aha! There it is!*
What an adventure!*
I always believed there was life on Mars and I was right!*
I think I deserve a treat.
