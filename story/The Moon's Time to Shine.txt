The sky is clear.*
The night is fine.*
The moon now has its time to shine!*
From here on Earth, the moon looks bright.*
But did you know it makes no light?*
The moon is made of rock, you know.*
The question is, what makes it glow?*
The sun's light hits the moon in space, and that lights up its rocky face.*
The light that bounces off, you see, comes speeding down to you and me.*
The moon is moving as it glows.*
Round and round the earth it goes!*
The earth and moon go round the sun.*
In one whole year, their trip is done.*
Because of how the moon is lit, we see it all or just a bit.*
But there is more for us to know.*
We want to visit.*
Off we go!*
Before too long, our ship can land.*
What adventures we have planned!*
We drop the ladder.*
Down we go.*
Easy does it.*
Nice and slow.*
The moon has dust and craters, too.*
Hiking here is fun to do!*
The moon has weaker gravity.*
Here we jump much higher.*
Have we had fun?*
Oh, yes. A lot!*
We plant a flag to mark the spot.*
The time has come to end our trip.*
Goodbye, moon! Hello, ship!*
Back on Earth, we see its light.*
It shines by day as well as night.*
Keep shining, moon!
