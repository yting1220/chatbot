A fire engine goes by.*
There is a fire.*
Everyone runs to see.*
"Please get back," says a fireman.*
"It is dangerous."*
A building is on fire.*
A white dog runs to the building.*
She barks and barks.*
Floppy runs to the building.*
He jumps in the window.*
"Please get Floppy," says Chip.*
The firemen try to open the door.*
Floppy runs out.*
He has some puppies.*
The puppies are safe.*
"Well done, Floppy!" says Kipper.*
"What a good dog!" says everyone.*
What a hero!
