Bobby blew lots of bubbles.*
Some of the bubbles popped.*
Some of the bubbles floated up, up, up into the sky.*
Where did they go?*
Bibble lived in space,millions of miles away.*
Bibble liked catching bubbles.*
One day, the bubbles stopped.*
Bibble wanted to find out why.*
Bibble built a bubble spaceship!*
He went to find the bubbles.*
Bibble landed in Bobby's garden.*
"What is your name?" asked Bobby.*
"Bibble," said Bibble.*
"My name is Bobby," said Bobby.*
Bibble made a little bubble spaceship for Bobby.*
It was just like the one he came to Earth in.*
When there was no bubble mix left Bobby and Bibble made some more.*
Bobby and Bibble blew lots of bubbles.*
Bibble made bubble animals and even rode a bubble bicycle!*
Bobby and Bibble had lots of fun.*
Then Bibble had to go home.*
Bobby waved goodbye.*
He felt sad.*
But Bibble left a special gift, a bubble that did not pop.*
Now Bobby feels happy.*
Maybe Bibble will come back one day.
