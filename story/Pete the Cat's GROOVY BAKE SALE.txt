Pete Cat is excited about his school bake sale.*
Pete wants to bake a treat.*
What should Pete bake?*
Pete loves sweets.*
Pete loves cookies.*
Pete loves pies.*
Pete loves brownies, cakes, marshmallow treats, and ice-cream sundaes.*
"I'll make cookies!" Pete thinks.*
Pete takes out eggs, flour, sugar, and of course, chocolate chips.*
He puts every thing in a bowl.*
He stirs and stirs.*
Pete makes a big mess!*
He rolls the dough into balls, and his mom helps put them into the oven.*
They wait for the cookies to bake.*
They smell so yummy.*
Then things smell less yummy.*
Some of the cookies are burned!*
Pete has to start over.*
What else can he make?*
He tries to make ice-cream sundaes, but they turn into ice-cream soup.*
He tries to make pudding pie but runs out of crust.*
The kitchen is a big mess.*
He has no treats for the bake sale.*
"You'll find something yummy to bring to the bake sale," says Pete's mom.*
He has some berries, vanilla pudding, and a few cookie pieces.*
"I've got it!" Pete says.*
"I'll use a little bit of all of it!"*
So he adds whipped cream and berries to the pudding and stirs.*
Then he adds some cookie pieces to the mix.*
Carefully, he scoops some onto a tray.*
Pete puts the tray in the fridge.*
The next morning, it is a tray of tasty, groovy berry goodness!*
His mom helps him scoop his treats into little cups.*
He brings them to school.*
Pete puts his berry cups on the bake sale table.*
"What is that?" asks Callie.*
"Groovy berry goodness!" says Pete.*
His friends give it a try.*
His dessert is a hit!*
Soon all the treats are gone.*
But Pete saves one.*
He gives it to his mom.*
"Thanks for your help!"
