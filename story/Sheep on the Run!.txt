Farmer Green is ill.*
He is in bed.*
"l cannot feed the sheep and pigs!" says Farmer Green.*
"l will feed them for you," says Lee.*
"Good! But you must shut the sheep and pigs in the pens," says Farmer Green.*
Lee feeds the sheep.*
The sheep eat.*
But then, Lee forgets to shut the pen!*
The sheep are on the run.*
Lee feeds the pigs.*
The pigs eat.*
But then Lee sees a sheep in the pig pen.*
Then Lee sees a sheep in the mud.*
And then Lee sees three sheep in the jeep.*
Lee shuts the sheep back in the pen.*
Then Lee sets off to see Farmer Green.*
"Did you shut the pen?" says Farmer Green.*
"Yes," says Lee.*
"All the sheep are in the pen."*
But no! Look at this sheep... asleep.
