Little Dinosaur wakes up.*
He packs his book bag.*
He packs his lunch box.*
He is getting ready for school.*
"Little Dinosaur," says Spikey.*
"it is summer. There is no school."*
"I am getting ready," says Little Dinosaur.*
"I am getting ready for school."*
Each day, Little Dinosaur wakes up.*
He packs his book bag.*
He packs his lunch box.*
He waits for the school bus.*
Each day, Spikey wakes up.*
"It is summer," he says.*
"Little Dinosaur is getting ready. But not me!"*
It is time for school.*
Little Dinosaur wakes up.*
He is ready.*
Spikey wakes up.*
Oh, no! His book bag is not ready.*
Oh, no! His lunch box is not ready.*
Will he be late?*
Little Dinosaur waits for the bus.*
He waits at the bus stop.*
Here is the bus.*
Where is Spikey?*
"Wait," says Little Dinosaur.*
"Wait for Spikey!"*
"Here I am," says Spikey.*
"I was not ready! But tomorrow I will be! Just like you, Little Dinosaur!"*
And he is.
