Nancy and Teddy have an appointment with the dentist.*
It is Teddy's first appointment ever.*
Nancy says, "I can show you what to do!"*
Nancy sits in a big chair that the dentist can move up and down.*
"You are sitting really still!"*
"Open wide!" says the dentist.*
She uses a small mirror to look inside Nancy's mouth.*
"Let's polish your teeth," says the dentist.*
It tickles, but Nancy keeps still.*
"Rinse and spit!" says the dental nurse.*
Now the dentist is looking in Teddy's mouth.*
"Open wide, Teddy," says Nancy.*
"Look," says the dentist.*
"Teddy's first tooth!"*
Then the dentist shows Nancy how to brush her teeth the right way.*
"I can brush them all by myself!" she says.
