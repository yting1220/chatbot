"Someone stop that ape-thief!" a woman cries.*
Man-Bat and Gorilla Grodd are robbing a bank.*
"Help!" a man yells.*
"That is a big bat!"*
"I think I heard someone yell, big bat! That is me . . . sort of."*
Batman spins the bad guys up in his Batrope.*
"That should hold both of you!"*
Just then the police chief calls out to Batman.*
"It is a good thing I got you," he cries.*
"Bane is going south toward the other bank. You must stop him!"*
"I just got two thieves," Batman thinks.*
"And the police chief did not even say thank you."*
Batman heads south anyway.*
Bane thinks he hears thunder.*
But it is not thunder.*
It is the Batplane!*
"That is it for you, Bane!" Batman says.*
Soon, the police chief finds Batman again.*
Will he say thank you?*
NO!*
"I need you to head north," the chief says.*
"Mr Freeze is on the loose."*
Batman finds Wonder Woman and Superman trapped in ice.*
He thaws it and sets them free.*
"Mr Freeze went north," Superman says.*
Batman thinks, "Still no th-"*
"Oh, and thank you for helping us thaw," Superman says.*
Batman smiles. "You are welcome. Let's head north and get that frozen thief!"
