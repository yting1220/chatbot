Buzz, Bee!*
A bee flies in the air.*
It looks for a flower.*
There is a sweet treat in flowers.*
It is called nectar.*
The bee drinks.*
The bee eats.*
It eats pollen.*
Bees carry pollen in a basket on their legs.*
It gets pollen to take home.*
A bee's home is called a hive.*
Many bees live in the hive.*
Bees put pollen in the hive.*
Once nectar becomes honey, bees put it in a honeycomb.*
They make honey from nectar, too.*
Now there food in the hive.*
Other bees can eat the pollen and honey.*
In the hive, a bee dances.*
The dance tells other bees where to find nectar.*
The bee moves from side to side.*
This is called a "waggle dance."*
The bees fly out of the hive.*
They look for the nectar.*
They use the dance to find the right flower!*
Buzz, bee!
