Fox does not like winter.*
In winter, Elephant and the Birds go south.*
"Goodbye, Fox!" says Elephant.*
"See you in spring!" say the Birds.*
Bear, Frog, and Turtle go to bed.*
"Good night, Fox!" says Bear.*
"See you in spring!" says Frog.*
"Glug, glug, glug!" says Turtle.*
And Rabbit?*
Who knows where Rabbit goes?*
Fox is alone.*
Fox is lonely.*
"I know," says Fox.*
"I will make new friends!"*
Fox makes new friends.*
"Snowball fight!"*
His new friends are not as good as his old friends.*
"I know," says Fox.*
"I will go south!"*
But Fox is too late.*
"I know," says Fox.*
"I will go to bed!"*
But Fox is too bored.*
"I have had it!" yells Fox.*
"I will just have to fight winter!"*
Fox fights winter.*
But winter fights back.*
"Oh, boo," says Fox.*
"Fox, is that you?"*
"It is me," says Fox.*
"Rabbit, is that you?"*
"It is me," says Rabbit.*
"What are you doing?" asks Fox.*
"Shh," says Rabbit.*
"Listen."*
Fox listens.*
He hears nothing.*
Then he hears snow falling.*
Fox hears mice moving under the snow.*
"In winter, I like to be alone," says Rabbit.*
"I like to sit still and listen."*
"Can we be alone together?" asks Fox.*
Rabbit nods.*
Fox smiles.*
Maybe winter is not so bad.
