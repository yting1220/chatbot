The game is on.*
Batter up.*
Pups play Jets.*
Jack steps up.*
He swings the bat.*
Crack.*
A hit.*
The ball goes past a red Jets mitt.*
It rolls and rolls out to the wall.*
Big Bill runs out.*
He grabs the ball.*
Big Bill runs fast.*
The Pups all call, "Come back, Big Bill! We need our ball!"*
Pups and Jets go after Bill.*
They run.*
They trip.*
Here comes Jill.*
Jill can run.*
Bill can jump.*
But stop?*
Oh, no.*
Here comes the ump.*
His hands are out.*
He tilts.*
He tips.*
Big Bill stops.*
He dips.*
He yips.*
Bill plays a game of keep-away.*
He wants to run and romp and play.*
Jill needs a plan.*
Think hard, Jill.*
How can you get that ball from Bill?*
Bill cocks his head.*
He looks around.*
That is when he hears a sound.*
"Hot dog! Hot dog! Come and get it!"*
Jill calls Bill.*
He sees the snack.*
Sniff, sniff! Woof.*
Bill runs back.*
Bill licks his lips.*
He gulps the snack.*
Jill grabs the ball.*
She throws to Jack.*
The T-ball game is back on track.*
Next up to hit?*
It is Jill.*
She smacks the ball.
