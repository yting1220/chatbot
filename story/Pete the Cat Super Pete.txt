Pete the Cat is out for a walk.*
Pete listens to the owls.*
He listens to the frogs.*
Just then, Pete hears a beep.*
It is not coming from outside.*
It is coming from his watch.*
Pete races home.*
It is time for Pete the Cat to become Super Pete.*
Pete presses a button in his room.*
The wall slides away.*
Pete sees a set of steps.*
Down, down, down he goes.*
Pete steps into his lair.*
It is full of groovy things to help him fight crime.*
Pete the Cat puts on his awesome cat suit.*
He puts on his cape and his sneakers.*
Now Super Pete is ready to save the city.*
Pete sees a flashing light.*
There is a message on his computer.*
It is the mayor.*
"Come quick, Super Pete," the mayor says.*
"We need your help! There is trouble at the warehouse!"*
Pete pulls a lever.*
Whoosh.*
Pete's nifty jet sinks into his lair.*
Pete hops into the jet.*
He zips into the air.*
Super Pete is on his way to save the day.*
Pete races through the sky.*
He hits a button.*
The jet shimmers.*
The jet disappears.*
Now the jet is invisible.*
No one will know Super Pete is coming.*
Pete hovers over the warehouse.*
He straps on a parachute.*
He jumps.*
Pete lands on the roof.*
He goes inside the warehouse.*
It is dark.*
He cannot see.*
Pete puts on his night vision goggles.*
He sees two bad guys.*
They are carrying a box.*
Pete picks up a rock.*
He puts it in his slingshot.*
The rock hits the box.*
The bad guys drop the box.*
They climb out a window.*
Pete races to the window.*
The bad guys have a boat.*
They are getting away.*
Pete pushes a button on his cat suit.*
His sneakers turn to flippers.*
A mask closes over his face.*
Pete jumps into the water.*
He swims after the bad guys.*
Pete takes a rope from his pocket.*
He twirls it over his head.*
Pete aims.*
He throws.*
The rope catches the boat.*
Pete pulls himself along the rope.*
Pete climbs into the bad guys' boat.*
He ties up the bad guys.*
Pete pushes a button on his watch.*
His jet appears above him.*
Pete pulls the bad guys into his jet.*
Pete brings the bad guys to the mayor.*
Super Pete saved the day.
