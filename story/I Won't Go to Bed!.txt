The clock said nine.*
Jake should have been asleep.*
But he was not.*
Jake wanted to stay up all night.*
"I will not go to bed," said Jake.*
"I will not. I am going to stay up all night."*
"Well, I'm going to bed," said his father.*
"I am not staying upall night."*
Jake sat in his father's chair.*
He felt big.*
He felt important.*
"I will not go to bed," he said again.*
"I am going to stay up all night."*
Jake switched the television on and off.*
"Nothing good on TV," he said to no one but himself.*
"Maybe I should read the newspaper."*
After a while, Jake sat himself at the bottom of the steps.*
In the quiet of the night he listened to his father snore.*
Around ten o'clock a mouse dashed across the foor.*
"Hello, mouse!"*
At eleven o'clock an owl hooted.*
Shadows moved along the wall.*
A window rattled.*
Jake shivered just a little.*
The clock said twelve.*
The mouse ran back across the foor.*
He looked at Jake as if to ask, "Why are not you in bed?"*
"I am not going to bed," said Jake.*
"I am going to stay up all night."*
Jake put a blanket on the foor.*
He set the table for three.*
He was going to have a party!*
Jake sat at the head of the table.*
He wished he could begin the party.*
But no one came.*
Not even the mouse!*
"So what!" said Jake.*
"I can make my own party. I will sing!"*
Jake sang a few notes, then stopped.*
His voice sounded loud and strange against the quiet of the night.*
The grandfather's clock chimed.*
Jake was lonely.*
And tired.*
And bored.*
He made himself a bed on the floor.*
"I am not going to sleep," he said.*
"I am just going to take a little rest."*
While Jake slept, night was turning into day.*
Jake's father came down the stairs.*
Jake's dad patted him gently on the head.*
"Would you like me to help you upstairs to your bed?" he asked.*
Jake nodded yes.*
Together they went upstairs to sleep until morning.
