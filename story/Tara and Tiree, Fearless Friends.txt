When Jim was a boy in Canada, his family had dogs.*
Jim loved those dogs.*
They were like part of his family.*
When Jim grew up, he still loved dogs.*
He learned how to train them.*
He helped dogs learn to be good.*
He always said, "There is no such thing as a bad dog."*
Training dogs became Jim's job.*
Jim had two dogs named Tara and Tiree.*
Tara was mostly black.*
Tiree was mostly gold.*
Jim loved them both, and they loved him, too.*
Jim and his dogs liked the wintertime.*
They had good coats to keep warm.*
They played in the snow.*
They went for long walks.*
They liked going out, but they liked going back in, too.*
It was good to sit by the fire and listen to the wind.*
Jim's house was by a lake.*
Every winter there was ice on it.*
One day Jim went for a walk out on the lake.*
Tara and Tiree went too.*
The dogs loved to run across the ice.*
It was very cold.*
Jim was ready to go back home.*
Then all at once the ice broke.*
Jim fell into the cold, cold water.*
Jim called for help.*
No one was near.*
No one could hear him.*
But Tara and Tiree heard Jim and came running.*
Jim wanted the dogs to stay away.*
He was afraid for them.*
But Tiree loved Jim. She wanted to help.*
When she came near the hole, the ice broke again.*
Tiree fell into the water with Jim.*
The water was so cold.*
Jim knew he did not have much time.*
Jim tried to help Tiree get out.*
But the ice broke more and more.*
Jim hoped Tara would run away.*
He did not want her to fall in the water too.*
But Tara did not run away.*
She wanted to help.*
First Tara got down low.*
Then she came closer, little by little.*
The ice did not break.*
Jim put out his hand.*
Tara got very close.*
Then Jim got hold of Tara's collar.*
Jim held on.*
Tara pulled back, but Jim was too big.*
He was still in the cold water.*
Then Tiree did something very smart.*
She walked on Jim's back--up and out of the water!*
Tiree was cold, but she was safe!*
Did she run off the ice?*
No.*
She loved Jim too much to run away.*
Tiree got down on her belly like Tara.*
She got close to Jim.*
Jim held out his other hand.*
And he grabbed on to Tiree's collar!*
The two dogs pulled back hard.*
They slipped, but they didn't stop.*
Slowly they pulled Jim up onto the ice.*
He was safe.*
Tara and Tiree had saved his life!*
Soon they were all back in the house.*
They sat by the fire until they were warm again.*
Jim always said, "There is no such thing as a bad dog."*
Now Jim says something else, too: "There is such a thing as a brave and wonderful dog!"*
Jim is sure of this, because he has two of them, Tara and Tiree.
