In the summer, Henry and his big dog Mudge liked to on picnics.*
Henry packed the food.*
He packed jelly sandwiches, pears, and gingersnaps for himself.*
He packed dry dog food and popcorn for Mudge.*
They both drank water.*
One Sunday they went to the park for a picnic.*
Henry put all the food on a picnic table, while Mudge chased some ants under a tree.*
Mudge was so big that his tail went WHACK! every time he ran around the tree.*
WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! Henry laughed at him.*
Soon they began eating.*
Henry chewed his jelly sandwich while he chrew pieces of popcorn into Mudge's mouth.*
Mudge always liked dessert first on picnics.*
While they were eating, a yellow bee landed on Henry's pear.*
Henry didn't see the bee.*
Henry picked up his pear.*
"Ow!' Henry cried.*
Mudge jumped.*
The bee flew away.*
"Ow! Ow! Ow!" Henry cried.*
He shook his hand again and again and again.*
But his hand hurt more and more.*
It hurt a lot.*
Tears came to Henry's eyes.*
His hand hurt so much.*
It had a puffy white circle on it.*
Henry just had to cry.*
He sat down beside Mudge and held on to his hurting hand and cried.*
Mudge sniffed Henry's hair.*
Mudge sniffed Henry's hand.*
Mudge put his big nose in Henry's ear.*
But Henry kept crying.*
Then Mudge licked Henry's face.*
Mudge liked the taste.*
It was salty.*
So Mudge licked Henry's face again and again and again.*
Every tear that Henry cried Mudge licked away.*
Henry cried, Mudge licked, and the hand hurt.*
But in a while, the hand stopped hurting, Henry stopped crying, and Mudge stopped licking.*
Henry looked at Mudge and smiled.*
Henry picked up a gingersnap.*
He took one bite and gave Mudge the rest.*
"Thanks," said Henry.*
Mudge wagged his tail and waited for another cookie.*
On hot days Henry liked to give Mudge a bath.*
Henry liked it because he could play with the water hose and because he could cool off.*
Mudge hated it.*
Mudge knew when he was going to get a bath.*
He would see Henry looking for the dog shampoo.*
And when he saw Henry hooking up the water hose, he tried to hide under the steps.*
But it never worked.*
Henry would take Mudge into the front yard in the sun, and he would hose him down.*
Mudge hated it.*
His eyes drooped, his ears drooped, and his tail drooped.*
When he was all wet, he looked like a big walrus.*
Henry laughed at him.*
Then Henry would soap him up.*
Henry scrubbed his head and his neck and his back and his chest and his stomach and his legs and his tail.*
Mudge really hated this part.*
He drooped even more.*
Then Henry hosed Mudge down again.*
But before Henry could grab a towel, before Henry could get Mudge dry, Mudge always got Henry back.*
Because when Henry let go, Mudge started shaking.*
He started with his head, then he shook his neck and his back and his chest and his stomach and his legs and his tail.*
Mudge shook so hard that when he was done, he was mostly dry, and Henry was mostly wet.*
Then Mudge looked at Henry and wagged his tail while Henry dried Henry with the towel.*
Beside Henry's house was a big green hill.*
Late on summer days, Henry and Mudge went to the top of the green hill.*
They looked down.*
They saw Henry's white house.*
They saw Henry's blue bike.*
They saw Henry's wooden swing.*
On top of the green hill, Henry felt big.*
He felt like a king.*
He saw his things below him, and he felt very big.*
"I am King of the Green Hill," Henry said.*
He looked at Mudge.*
"You are my dragon."*
Mudge wagged his tail.*
"Your name," Henry said, "is Fireball."*
Mudge wagged again.*
"And you are very scary," Henry said.*
Mudge wagged some more.*
Henry and Mudge marched all over the top of the green hill.*
They met other kings who had dragons.*
They chased them away.*
They met monsters.*
Mudge ate them.*
They marched and marched till they could march no more.*
Then they found a magic tree on the green hill.*
It was a tree for kings and dragons who were tired.*
Henry and Mudge sat down under the tree.*
Henry put his arms around Mudge.*
They were glad for a magic tree.*
They closed their eyes.*
And a boy and a dog slept, together, on the green hill in their green time.
