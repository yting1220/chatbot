We are off to explore the jungle!*
We can learn so much by watching the amazing animals here.*
The jungle is alive with nature!*
Some creatures crawl on tree trunks or along the ground.*
Some creatures like to hide.*
Look at all the animals high up in the branches!*
If we are lucky, we might find an animal that no one has ever seen!*
It could be furry or scaly.*
It may fly, or crawl, or slither.*
We follow the winding river out of the jungle.*
The river animals play as our day comes to an end.*
Goodbye, jungle!
