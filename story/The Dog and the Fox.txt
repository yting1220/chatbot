The sun is up and so is Dog.*
Dog is bored. He wants to play.*
Dog gets a ball and runs to Fox.*
"Get up," says Dog.*
But Fox does not.*
Dog digs up a bone.*
It is big.*
"Get up," says Dog.*
But Fox does not.*
Dog runs in the sun.*
He gets hot.*
"Get up," says Dog.*
But Fox does not.*
Dog jumps in the pond.*
He is wet.*
"Get up," says Dog.*
But Fox does not.*
Dog sits in the sun.*
He is worn out.*
"Get up," says Dog.*
But Fox does not.*
The moon is up and so is Fox.*
Fox is bored.*
He wants to play.*
Fox gets a ball and runs to Dog.*
"Get up," says Fox.*
But Dog does not.
