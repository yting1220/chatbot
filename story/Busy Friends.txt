Hooray! My friend is here to play!*
We share our toys and laugh all day.*
When snack time comes and I say, "Please!"*
She will swap her carrots for my cheese.*
How many apples can you see?*
If I stumble and bump my knee, She is there to help and comfort me.*
Can you find two squirrels?*
Then at home time we hug and say, "See you again another day!"*
Where is the teddy bear?
