He charges into Two-Face's car!*
"You cheat!" Two-Face yells.*
"Cheer up," Batman says.*
The chase is over.*
"We will check him into jail," the cop says.*
"Batman," says the police chief.*
"Can we chat?"*
"The Riddler is in a robot stealing cash.*
Can you check on that?" asks the chief.*
"Yes," says Batman.*
The chase is on!*
"Charge!" The Riddler yells.*
"I mean cash. No need to charge. I have lots of cash. I can even make change."*

But The Riddler and the robot are too much.*
The chase is over.*
"Did someone say chase?"*
It is The Flash!*
"I love to chase crooks," he says.*
"No fair!" cries The Riddler.*
"Batman cheated. He called his friends!"*
"That is not cheating." Batman chuckles.*
"When I need my friends, they always charge to the rescue!"
