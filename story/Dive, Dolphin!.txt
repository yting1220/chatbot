Some have short beaks.*
These dolphins have stripes.*
This dolphin has spots.*
Some dolphins live in oceans.*
Others live in rivers.*
All dolphins have flippers, a fin, and a tail.*
Dolphins swim together.*
They work as a team to hunt fish.*
Dolphins like to play with things they find in the water.*
This dolphin plays with seaweed.*
They also like to leap and jump.*
A dolphin gets air through its blowhole.*
Then it dives back down into the water.*

They come to the top of the water to get air.*
Dive, dolphin!
