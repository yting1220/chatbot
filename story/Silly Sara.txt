Sara sat on a sofa.*
She sipped a smoothie.*
OOPS! The smoothie spilled.*
Silly Sara.*
Sara sat in the tub.*
She licked a lollipop.*
Plop! The lollipop dropped.*
Silly Sara.*
Silly Sara sat on her hat.*
Silly Sara tripped on her cat.*
Silly Sara slipped on the mat.*
Silly Sara missed with the bat.*
Sara chewed bubble gum.*
She blew a big bubble.*
Then a bigger bubble.*
Then the biggest bubble.*
Silly Sara.*
The door went slam.*
In came Sam.*
"You have a funny face."*
"Hey, want to race?"*
Sam and Sara scooted fast.*
Sara was first.*
Sam was last.*
Speedy Sara.*
Sam and Sara played hide-and-seek.*
Sara had to peek.*
"Eek!"*
Sara saw Sam.*
Sam and Sara sat on a seesaw.*
They licked ice cream.*
Sandy stepped on.*
Sara went up.*
Sara's ice cream fell down.*
SLURP! Sandy found it on the ground.*
Sara had a hunch it was time for lunch.*
Sara had jam.*
Sam had ham.*
Which?*
Sara and Sam had a jam ham sandwich.*
Sam gobbled up his Jam ham sandwich.*
"I am Super Sam!" he said.*
"Now you have a funny face," said Sara.*
Don't be silly, Sara.*
"Okay," she said.*
"I am not Silly Sara!"*
"I am Super Sara!"*
"And we are super pals!"
