Peppa, George and Rebecca Rabbit are going to visit a petting farm.*
"Mummy, what can we do there?", says Peppa.*
"You can feed and stroke tiny little animals," replies Mummy Pig.*
"Ooh!" gasps Rebecca.*
"I love tiny little animals!"*
Mrs Badger is the farmer who looks after the tiny little animals.*
"Before we meet them," she says, "there is one thing we have to do."*
"Wash our hands!" say Peppa and Rebecca.*
"That is right," says Mrs Badger.*
The children go to see the chickens first.*
"Would you like to feed them?" asks Mrs Badger.*
Peppa, George and Rebecca each take a bag of birdseed.*
"Here, chicky-chick!" calls Peppa.*
Next, Mrs Badger has a surprise for everyone.*
"Now ..." she says, "who wants to hold a baby chick?"*
"Me! Me! Me!" shout the children.*
Peppa giggles.*
The chicks are so fluffy and sweet!*
Soon it is time for the children to wash their hands again and go to see some other animals.*
"These are the guinea pigs," says Mrs Badger.*
"Ooh," cries Rebecca. "Look at their cute little faces!"*
"And their fluffy little bodies!" says Peppa.*
"Guinea pigs make excellent pets," says Mrs Badger.*
"Can we have a pet guinea pig? Please?" asks Peppa.*
Daddy Pig frowns at Mummy Pig.*
"Er .. . look at the time," he says.*
"We have to be getting home."*
Mummy Rabbit comes to collect Rebecca.*
She has brought the baby twins, Rosie and Robbie.*
"Baby rabbits are SO cute," says Peppa.*
"Please can we cuddle them?"*
Mummy Rabbit nods.*
There is just one thing to do first ...*
Now Peppa and Rebecca's hands are clean, they can cuddle the twins.*
"Have you had a nice time today?" asks Mummy Rabbit.*
"'Yes," laughs Peppa. "We have had lots of cuddles!"*
Peppa loves the petting farm.*
Everyone loves the petting farm!
