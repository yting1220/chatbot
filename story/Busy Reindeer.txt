Santa says, "It is Christmas Day! Ruby Reindeer, lead my sleigh."*
"What is going on top of the tree?"*
They fly up high, across the sky.*
Snowmen wave as they pass by.*
"How many snowmen can you count?"*
Outside, Ruby loves to play, While jolly Santa sneaks away!*
"What colour is Santa's sleigh?"*
Ruby feels sleepy from her flight.*
Santa says, "Thank you and goodnight."*
"Can you spot the little mouse?"
