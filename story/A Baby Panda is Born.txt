It is February 23, 2007.*
From all over the world, people have come to the zoo in Atlanta.*
There are TV crews and reporters.*
Why is everybody so excited?*
Everyone wants to see the new panda cub.*
Her name is Mei Lan.*
Mei Lan is four months old.*
But today is the first time visitors will see her.*
Mei Lan's mother is nearby.*
She watches to make sure her baby is safe.*
Where is Mei Lan's father?*
He lives in another part of the zoo.*
Mei Lan's mother takes care of her cub all by herself.*
Mei Lan was born at the zoo.*
At first, she was the size of a stick of butter.*
Her body was all pink with bits of white fuzz.*
Her eyes were closed.*
She couldn't see yet.*
She also cried a lot.*
She sounded like a little piglet.*
Two months later, her eyes fully opened.*
Her fur had turned black in many places.*
The rest of her fur was white.*
Now she looked like a panda!*
Being black and white may help pandas blend into the snow and dark rocks of China.*
That's where all wild pandas live.*
China is a very big country.*
Only Russia, Canada, and the United States are bigger.*
Pandas live in a very small area of China.*
The circle shows you where.*
Mei Lan's name is Chinese.*
It means "Atlanta beauty."*
These are the Chinese characters for her name.*
Pandas are important to the people of China.*
Special gold and silver coins have pictures of pandas on them.*
This animal is a red panda.*
Red pandas also live in China.*
Red pandas are cousins of giant pandas.*
But they don't look much like them.*
Red pandas look more like raccoons.*
Like most bears, pandas like to climb trees.*
Look how high this panda can climb!*
Up, up, up he goes!*
Splash!*
This panda just jumped into the river.*
Pandas are very good swimmers.*
Most bears are.*
But a panda is not your average bear!*
They weigh no more than 250 pounds.*
Polar bears are much bigger.*
So are Kodiak bears.*
Most bears sleep through the cold winter.*
But not pandas.*
That is because it does not get very cold in the part of China where they live.*
Most bears are meat eaters.*
This grizzly bear is hunting an elk.*
Grizzlies also like to eat fish and squirrels.*
But pandas hardly ever eat meat.*
What do they like to eat?*
Bamboo!*
Bamboo is a type of long, hard grass.*
Pandas eat bamboo shoots and leaves.*
A panda can spend half its life eating!*
Can you imagine?*
Pandas have special paws.*
Each paw has five claws plus an extra bone.*
It is sort of like a thumb, but it can't bend or move.*
Their special paws help pandas hold bamboo.*
At about six months old, cubs start eating bamboo.*
Before that, babies need only their mothers' milk.*
Mothers do their best to protect their babies.*
This panda mother sees a jackal.*
She growls to scare him away.*
She must also watch out for leopards.*
In China, there are probably.*
around 1,600 pandas in the wild.*
That's not very many.*
In the last few years, more pandas have been born in zoos and nature reserves. *
That's why everyone was so excited about Mei Lan.*
Why are there so few pandas in the wild?*
One reason is that so many people live in China-more than one billion.*
That's way more than in any other country in the world.*
In China, more and more homes are built near where pandas live.*
Pandas are very shy animals.*
They are afraid to look for bamboo near people's homes.*
So some pandas can't find enough food to eat.*
There are new laws to protect pandas.*
People can't build houses too close to where they live.*
People can't hunt pandas anymore.*
Anyone who kills a panda is sent to jail for a long time.*
At the zoo in Atlanta, Mei Lan will always have plenty of food.*
And she will always be safe.*
Is she lonely with no other panda cubs?*
No.*
She likes to climb and explore.*
All she needs is her mother.*
But in a few years, she will be fully grown.*
Then she will be ready to have a panda cub of her own!*
For now she loves lying in her hammock in the sun.
