"Lots and lots of grass. But I must warn you, it is a little dry."*
"Ugh. That is even more boring than cat food."*
"Hey, Whale! Up here! I am really hungry and searching for something yummy to eat that does not wiggle, bounce, or bite and that is not too big, too dry, or too boring. What does a whale eat?"*
"My food is perfect," sang Whale.*
"It is none of those things, and it certainly is not boring."*
"In fact, my food glows in the dark."*
"But I must warn you, it is hard to pronounce."*
"It is called bioluminescent phytoplankton."*
Phyto-what? Whale's food is too weird.*
Is not there anything yummy for me to eat?*
"Hi, Cat," squeaked Mouse.*
"I am hungry and searching for something yummy to eat. What does a cat eat?"*
"Hmm ... I think I have just figured it out. But I must warn you..."*
"Excuse me, Elephant. I am so very hungry and searching for something yummy to eat that does not wiggle, bounce, or bite and that is not too big. What does an elephant eat?"*
"Never mind. There is no way I am eating one of those."*
"Zebras!" roared Lion, as he sprang after his striped prey.*
"But I must warn you..."*
"Lion, please help. I am hungry and searching for something yummy to eat that does not wiggle, bounce, or bite. What does a lion eat?"*
"Yikes! I will not eat that!"*
"Ants," replied Chimp.*
"We use sticks to get them out of trees. But I must warn you, they bite."*
"Hello, Chimp. I am hungry and searching for something yummy to eat that does not wiggle or bounce. What does a chimp eat?"*
"Rabbits," replied Fox, as he pounced on a furry, long-eared critter.*
"But I must warn you, they bounce."*
"Hello, Fox. I am hungry and searching for something yummy to eat that does not wiggle. What does a fox eat?"*
"Eww. No, thank you."*
"Worms, of course. But I must warn you, they wiggle."*
"Hello, Tortoise. I am hungry and searching for something yummy to eat. What does a tortoise eat?"*
But if I do not eat cat food, what will I eat?*
It is dry and dull and not very yummy. Yuck.*
But I am a cat, and I will NOT eat cat food.*
Dogs eat dog food.*
Fish eat fish food.
