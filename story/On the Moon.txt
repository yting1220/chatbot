This story is about a rocket, astronauts and the Moon.*
The Moon is very far away.*
Astronauts have been there.*
"I am an astronaut too!"*
The astronauts sat at the very top of a rocket.*
The rocket flew into space.*
It took four whole days to reach the Moon.*
The astronauts landed in a little spaceship.*
They put on space suits to go outside.*
The Moon was quiet and very dusty.*
There were mountains and huge holes called craters.*
The astronauts felt light and floaty.*
They could jump really far.*
They explored in a Moon buggy.*
They took photos and collected rocks.*
They even put up a flag.*
They looked at our world.*
It was very far away!*
Then they blasted off for home.*
The buggy, the flag and their footprints are still there.*
