Howdy!*
My name is Roy.*
This is my sister, Meg, and her doll, Dolly.*
We live on the A OK Ranch.*
I am a good cowboy.*
I can rope.*
I can round up strays.*
"Get along, little doggie!"*
But there is one thing.*
I cannot do.*
I cannot ride like the other cowboys.*
"Look at Jesse and James!" I say.*
Meg says, "I don't like them. They are not nice cowboys."*
"Maybe so," I say.*
"But they sure can ride!"*
I go to the barn.*
There is my new bike.*
I wish I could ride it.*
I call my bike Silver.*
It is the best bike in the West!*
I will try again to ride.*
I hop on Silver.*
Silver bucks and bucks.*
Then Silver throws me off.*
Shucks!*
So my dad puts on some training wheels.*
Meg says, "Try again, Roy. You can do it!"*
I try again.*
I can ride with the training wheels.*
But do I feel like a cowboy?*
No!*
I feel like a cowbaby!*
Uh-oh.*
Here come Jesse and James.*
"Look at Roy," says Jesse.*
"He can't ride the real way."*
"What a baby!" says James.*
"Don't make fun of my brother!" Meg yells.*
Jesse and James laugh.*
Then they ride away.*
"Don't feel bad," Meg tells me.*
But I do.*
The next day I take off my training wheels.*
I don't want to look like a baby.*
I want to ride like a cowboy.*
Meg and I head up to Dry Gulch.*
She helps me get on my bike.*
And she helps me get up each time I fall!*
Oh no!*
Look who came back.*
Jesse and James.*
What are they up to?*
I know one thing.*
They are up to no good!*
Jesse and James grab Dolly.*
"Stop!" Meg yells.*
"Stop!" I yell, too.*
But Jesse and James do not give Dolly back.*
"We are outlaws!" says Jesse.*
"Your doll is coming with us!" says James.*
They laugh and ride off.*
Meg starts to cry.*
"Don't worry," I tell her.*
"We can catch them."*
But Jesse and James are too fast for us.*
There is only one way to catch Jesse and James.*
I hop on Silver.*
I take a deep breath.*
I shout, "Giddy-up, Silver!"*
I roll fast down the hill.*
Silver bucks and bucks.*
But I hang on.*
This time I do not fall off.*
I am riding like a cowboy!*
Yee-haw!*
I catch up with Jesse and James.*
Yikes! I cannot stop!*
I crash into Jesse and James!*
But I catch Dolly.*
Jesse and James are crying like cowbabies.*
They head for the hills.*
Silver and I look for my sister.*
"Meg!" I shout.*
"I can ride!"*
I give Meg back her doll.*
"Oh, thank you, Roy!" she says.*
"You are the best cowboy in the West!"*
I pat Silver.*
I know how to make Silver go.*
Now I just need to learn how to make him stop!
