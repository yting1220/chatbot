Pizza! What a dish.*
Pig makes pizza as you wish.*
Shop is crowded day and night.*
Pig makes every pie just right.*
Hungry diners take a seat.*
Pizza! What a treat.*
Bears get pizza topped with jam.*
Gulls get pizza topped with clams.*
Penguins like their pizza cold.*
Rats want cheese with extra mold.*
Topped with carrots.*
Topped with fish.*
Pizza! As you wish.*
Sloths lean back and take it slow.*
Monkeys eat it on the go.*
Frogs eat quick with sticky flicks.*
Poodles eat while doing tricks.*
Topped with tin cans.*
Topped with twigs.*
Topped with slop for muddy pigs.*
Eating.*
Laughing.*
Having fun.*
Happy diners.*
Pig makes every pie just right.*
So why will not Turtle take a bite?*
Pig is worried.*
What is wrong?*
Did he cook the worms too long?*
Did he undercook the slugs?*
Did he add the fresh green bugs?*
Turtle hides inside her shell.*
What is wrong?*
It is hard to tell.*
Perhaps a seaweed pie instead?*
Turtle peeks.*
She shakes her head.*
Pig brings out another tray.*
Turtle's shy.*
She looks away.*
Pig's tail droops.*
What can he bring?*
Pizza topped with everything.*
Turtle sinks down in her seat.*
What is wrong?*
Why will not she eat?*
Pig looks here.*
Pig looks there.*
Then he spies the empty chair.*
Now he knows just what to do!*
Pizza! Made for two.*
Hungry Pig sits in the chair.*
Pizza! Best for friends to share.*
Turtle smiles and takes a bite.*
"Yum!" she says.*
"This pie's just right!"
