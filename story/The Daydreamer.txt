Daisy has no money.*
"Take my milk to market," says the farmer.*
"I will give you a gold coin."*
"Yes!" says Daisy.*
And she sets off for the market.*
"Soon I will have some money," she thinks.*
I can buy a hen.*
My hen will lay lots of eggs.*
I can sell my eggs.*
I will have lots of money!*
I will buy a pretty dress and sparkly shoes.*
But I will not get dressed by myself.*
I will have servants to help me!*
I will marry a prince.*
I will be a princess.*
We will live in a palace with golden gates.*
We will have a ball.*
I will twirl and whirl in my new dress.*
The milk is gone! Poor Daisy.*
"Cheer up! There's no use crying over spilt milk."
