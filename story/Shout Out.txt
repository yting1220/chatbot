"Batman!" the police chief shouts.*
"You should see this! All of the bad guys are on the loose."*
Batman is in shock.*
"All of the bad guys?" he says.*
"I am not sure I can take on all the bad guys."*
Just then, Batman's Super Hero friends shoot out of the sky.*
"We are here to help!" they shout.*
"You are in good shape now," says Superman.*
"I will show you how this is done," says Superman.*
"Show me how it is done?" says Batman.*
"More like show off! I do not need you. I was already in good shape."*
Batman shouts at Superman.*
Superman shouts at Batman.*
"Sheesh!" says Wonder Woman.*
"You two should grow up!" says Batgirl.*
"I guess we should show them how it is done," says Wonder Woman.*
"You got it!"' says Batgirl.*
"I like to share the fun of catching crooks."*
They catch the crooks at the art shop.*
"You should not steal," Batgirl tells them.*
They catch Catwoman getting away.*
"Aw, shucks!" says Catwoman.*
"Are the boys still shouting?" asks Wonder Woman.*
"Maybe it is a shout-out to us!" Batgirl laughs.
