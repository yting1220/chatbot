Honey Bunny Funnybunny sat next to Eddy Bear.*
He was the cutest bear in school.*
He had big round eyes.*
He had the best brown nose.*
He had a crooked smile.*
Eddy Bear made Honey Bunny laugh.*
One time he wore two different shoes.*
Another time he read his book upside down.*
And he was always walking into walls!*
Honey Bunny liked Eddy Bear.*
She wanted him to like her, too.*
So she wore her best dress.*
Then she gave Eddy her nicest smile.*
He did not smile back.*
She left a present on Eddy's chair.*
Eddy sat on it.*
Honey Bunny tried to help Eddy in science class.*
Her help was not so helpful.*
She threw him a ball at recess.*
The ball bounced off Eddy's head.*
Honey Bunny even painted a heart for Eddy.*
She put his name in the middle.*
Eddy Bear did not want Honey Bunny's heart.*
Honey Bunny was very sad.*
Eddy Bear did not like her.*
Honey Bunny did not eat her dinner that night.*
She went to bed early.*
Honey Bunny felt better in the morning.*
Eddy Bear might not like her.*
But she could still like him.*
Honey Bunny ran onto the playground.*
She looked for Eddy.*
The only bear she saw was wearing glasses?*
Eddy Bear was wearing glasses.*
For the first time, his big brown eyes were looking right at her.
