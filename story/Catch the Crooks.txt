It is a busy day.*
"There are so many crooks to catch," says Superman.*
All the Super Heroes are there except Batman.*
Green Lantern has to catch Poison Ivy.*
He uses a plant to snatch her.*
"A plant would not touch me," she says.*
"I have a hunch this plant will," Green Lantern says.*
Aquaman has to catch the Penguin.*
He calls a sea creature to help him!*
"Have you met my friend?" Aquaman asks the Penguin.*
"He loves to play fetch."*
Wonder Woman has to catch Harley Quinn.*
"You will never reach me," Harley says.*
"Watch this!" Wonder Woman tells her.*
"My lasso has a much longer reach than I do."*
Superman has to catch the Joker.*
"You have met your match," Superman says.*
"And that is no joke."*
Soon, there are no more crooks to catch.*
"Let's have lunch," says Wonder Woman.*
Just then, Batman finally arrives.*
"Did you say lunch?" he asks.*
"My sandwich is gone!" says Wonder Woman.*
"Crunch, munch, munch," says Batman.*
"Now what will I have for lunch?" Wonder Woman asks.*
"I guess we did have one more crook to catch," says Superman.*
"I am not a crook!" Batman tells them.*
"I was just hungry. It was time for lunch."
