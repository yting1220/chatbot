A teeny tiny woman lived in a teeny tiny house.*
One day she put on her teeny tiny hat.*
She got her teeny tiny bag.*
And she went for a teeny tiny walk.*
Soon the teeny tiny woman came to a teeny tiny gate.*
She opened the teeny tiny gate and went into a teeny tiny yard.*
There she saw a teeny tiny bone on a teeny tiny grave.*
"I can make some teeny tiny soup with this teeny tiny bone," said the teeny tiny woman.*
The teeny tiny woman put the teeny tiny bone in her teeny tiny bag.*
She went through the teeny tiny gate.*
She walked and walked and walked all the way back to her teeny tiny house.*
The teeny tiny woman opened her teeny tiny door.*
"My teeny tiny feet are tired," said the teeny tiny woman.*
"I will not make my teeny tiny soup now!"*
The teeny tiny woman put the teeny tiny bone in a teeny tiny cupboard.*
Then she got into her teeny tiny bed for a teeny tiny nap.*
Soon a teeny tiny voice called, "Give me my bone!"*
The teeny tiny woman was a teeny tiny bit scared.*
"I must have had a teeny tiny dream," she said.*
The teeny tiny woman had a teeny tiny glass of milk.*
Then she got back into her teeny tiny bed.*
Soon she fell asleep.*
It was not long before the teeny tiny voice called out again.*
"Give me my bone!"*
The teeny tiny woman woke up.*
She was so scared she hid under her teeny tiny covers.*
But the teeny tiny voice called out again.*
And now it was not teeny tiny at all.*
"Give me my bone!"*
The teeny tiny woman peeked out from her teeny tiny covers.*
She said, "Take it!"*
And that is the end of this teeny tiny story.
