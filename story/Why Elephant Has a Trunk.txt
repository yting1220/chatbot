There was a time when Elephant had no trunk.*
He was very big and very smelly.*
"You should have a wash, Elephant. You are very smelly," said Chameleon.*
"I can't wash," said Elephant.*
"I am too big."*
"You should have a bath, then," said Chameleon.*
"Hippo will help."*
Elephant went to the water to have a bath.*
"Get in," said Hippo.*
"Snap! Snap! Snap!" said Crocodile.*
"No! You can not get in."*
"This is no good. All the animals will call me smelly if I can not have a bath," said Elephant.*
And then, "Snap! Snap! Snap!" Crocodile snapped Elephant on the nose!*
"Help!" said Elephant.*
All the animals helped.*
"Pull!" said Hippo.*
The animals pulled and they pulled.*
But Crocodile did not let go.*
Elephant's nose got longer and longer and longer.*
Then... Crocodile let go.*
"My nose!" said Elephant.*
"It is so long now!"*
Then Elephant had a good wash with his long nose.*
"Now I am not smelly!" he said.*
"I have got a good long nose," said Elephant.*
"I will call it a trunk."*
And that is why Elephant has a trunk.
