It is fall.*
"Do you want to find a pumpkin with me, Rocket?" Bella asks.*
"Yes!" Rocket says.*
"Today is the perfect day to find a pumpkin!"*
Rocket and Bella go up the hill to the pumpkin patch.*
The pumpkin patch is full of pumpkins.*
Some are big.*
Some are small.*
Some have bumps.*
Some have spots.*
There are so many shapes and sizes.*
Rocket sees a pumpkin he likes.*
It is big, round, and very orange.*
"It is the perfect pumpkin!" says Bella.*
The pumpkin is too heavy to carry.*
Rocket and Bella push and push.*
The pumpkin starts to roll.*
They push and push.*
The pumpkin rolls faster.*
Oh, no!" says Rocket.*
The pumpkin is getting away.*
Rocket and Bella run down, down, down the hill.*
The pumpkin rolls down, down, down the hill.*
The pumpkin bumps into Mr Barker's house.*
Mr Barker wakes up.*
Mr Barker is not happy.*
Bark! Bark! Bark!*
He sniffs the pumpkin.*
It is big, round, and very orange.*
Rocket and Bella reach Mr Barker's house.*
"Sorry!" Bella says. Our pumpkin got away."*
"That is a perfect pumpkin!" Mr Barker says.*
"You may have it!" says Bella.*
"Yes, it is for you!" Rocket agrees.*
Mr Barker loves his pumpkin.*
He is very happy.*
"Making friends happy feels even better than having a perfect pumpkin," says Rocket.*
"Yes," Bella says.*
"Making friends happy feels great indeed!"
