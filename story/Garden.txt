Butterflies are fluttering around a sunny garden.*
SQUEAK! Who can that be under a leaf?*
It is a little mouse!*
The little mouse scampers under the pretty flowers.*
What is that busy buzzing?*
To make into yummy honey.*
Where is the little mouse gone now?*
She is taking a sip from the garden pond.*
Hop, hop... SPLASH! Who was that?*
A green speckled frog, diving down deep.*
The little mouse tiptoes through the long grass.*
Who else is here?*
A hungry bird, pulling up a worm.*
Where is the little mouse gone now?*
She is nibbling a juicy strawberry.*
Someone is in the cabbages... slimy snails, munching their lunch.*
The little mouse clambers under a spider's web, over a shiny beetle, and disappears,  to snuggle with her babies.
