Whales live in the ocean.*
Some whales can swim in warm water.*
Other whales can swim where it is cold.*
When some whales dive, their flukes go up.*
Then the whale goes down.*
A whale can swim deep in the water.*
Its flukes and fippers help it move.*
When the flukes go up and down the whale moves forward.*
Its two flippers help the whale turn as it looks for food.*
These whales chase food deep in the ocean.*
They catch squid and fish with their teeth.*
Other whales do not have teeth.*
They have baleen.*
Bits of food get trapped on it.*
Then the whale eats the food.*
Blue whales have baleen.*
They are the world's biggest animals.*
But they eat food that is very small!*
Time to swim up!*
Whales need to breathe air.*
Air goes out a whale's blowhole.*
Thn the whale can breathe in.*
It is time to play.!
