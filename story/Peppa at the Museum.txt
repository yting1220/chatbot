Peppa and George are helping Grandpa Pig build a pond.*
"We will start by digging a hole," says Grandpa Pig.*
"Grandpa," asks Peppa. "What is that in the mud?"*
She has spotted something buried in the ground.*
Peppa has found a little teacup.*
It looks very old.*
"Dinesaw!" shouts George.*
He has found something, too!*
"Yes, George," says Peppa.*
"That does look like a dinosaur bone."*
Grandpa Pig keeps digging.*
He discovers a gold coin.*
More buried treasure!*
Granny Pig comes outside.*
She is carrying a garden gnome.*
"I bought it for the garden!" she says.*
Grandpa Pig does not like gnomes.*
"Do you really think we have found buried treasure?" asks Peppa.*
Grandpa Pig drives Peppa and George to the museum.*
"Let's find out!" he says.*
Mr Rabbit works at the museum.*
He is in charge of caring for old things.*
"Hello, Mr Rabbit!" says Peppa.*
"We have dug up some treasure!"*
She holds up her teacup.*
Grandpa Pig gets out his coin.*
"Fine china. Very interesting," says Mr Rabbit.*
"And a coin, too!"*
But George has found the best treasure of all.*
Mr Rabbit takes everyone to the amosqur room.*
"You found a thigh bone!" he cries.*
"It fits my dinosaur perfectly."*
"Hooray!" cheers Peppa.*
"Dinesaw! Grrr!" says George.*
"Thank you for bringing these valuable objects into the museum," says Mr Rabbit.*
"Valuable?" splutters Grandpa Pig.*
"Are they worth something?"*
Mr Rabbit nods. "Oh, yes! They are worth a lot of money."*
He puts Peppa's teacup and Grandpa Pig's coin in a glass case.*
Then he locks it up.*
Mr Rabbit wants to know if there is any more treasure buried in Grandpa Pig's garden.*
"Mr Bull is an expert at digging," he says.*
Mr Bull makes a very big hole, but he does not find much.*
"Same as usual," he says.*
"A load of broken pottery and smashed stuff."*
"Never mind," says Grandpa Pig.*
"You have dug my pond for me!"*
Mr Rabbit spots Granny Pig's gnome.*
"Now that is a rare treasure! It is very valuable."*
"The gnome should go to the museum!" Grandpa Pig decides.*
"Do not worry, Granny," chuckles Peppa.*
"I will visit it with you any time you like!"
