A turtle, a frog, a penguin, a lobster, and a gull went rowing in a small boat.*
From the water, a voice said, "Move over! Move over!"*
"Make a little room for me."*
So they all moved over and said,"Welcome aboard, Hippo. We have made a little room for you."*
"This is a small boat," said Lobster.*
"We do better not make room for anyone else."*
Then another voice said, " Move over! Move over!"*
"Make a little room for me."*
"There is no room," said Lobster.*
"Please," begged the duck.*
So they all moved over and made a little room for him.*
"This boat is really crowded," said Lobster.*
"We do better not make room for anyone else."*
"Move over! Move over!" said yet another voice.*
"Make a little room for me."*
"The boat is full," said Lobster.*
"There is definitely no more room!"*
"Please," begged the crab.*
"Pretty please."*
So they all moved over and made a little room for him.*
"This boat is much too full," said Hippo.*
"We do better not take any more."*
"Move over! Move over!" said a deep voice from the water.*
"Make a little room for me."*
"It is a really bad idea," said Lobster.*
"This boat will surely sink."*
"Oh, no it will not!" said Hippo.*
And he moved over and made a little room for Alligator.*
"This boat is low in the water," said Hippo.*
"But it is not sinking!"*
"Move over! Move over!" said a tiny, little voice.*
"Make a little room for me."*
"It is okay," said Duck.*
"Snail is so small."*
So they all moved over and went swimming!
