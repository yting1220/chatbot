My name is Ty.*
I love adventures.*
I wish my family would play.*
"Daddy, will you play with me?"*
"In a while, little man. I'm cooking dinner."*
I walk into the living room.*
"Momma, will you play with me?"*
"Not right now, honey. I'm folding clothes. Want to help?"*
I race upstairs to my big brother's room.*
"Corey, will you play with me?"*
"Sorry, Ty. I'm doing homework."*
I walk downstairs.*
I spot an empty box.*
I know just what to do.*
Time for fun!*
I climb inside.*
The floor is the track.*
The ceiling is the sky.*
I drive the train.*
I blow the whistle.*
"Woo-woo!"*
My train rumbles slowly.*
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga.*
Then it picks up steam.*
Clickety-clack.*
Clickety-clack.*
Clickety-clack.*
As I get to the first stop,*
I spot someone waiting Daddy!*
Daddy smiles and winks.*
"All aboard!"*
Our train rumbles slowly.*
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga.*
Then it picks up steam.*
Clickety-clack.*
Daddy blows the whistle.*
"Woo-woo!"*
We fly by farms and ponds.*
At the next stop, someone smiles and waves.*
Momma!*
"All aboard!"*
Our train rumbles slowly.*
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga.*
Then it picks up steam.*
Clickety-clack.*
Momma blows the whistle.*
"Woo-woo!"*
We dash through a city.*
At the next stop, someone smiles and points at me.*
Corey!*
"All aboard!"*
Corey blows the whistle.*
"Woo-woo!"*
We chug across a bridge.*
We zoom into a tunnel.*
Momma and Daddy cheer me on.*
"Check out the view!" Corey says.*
We're on top of the world.*
As we get to the next stop, I smell something yummy.*
I know just what to do.*
"Last stop! Home."*
Time for food!
